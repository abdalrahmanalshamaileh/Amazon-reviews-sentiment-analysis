Project Functionality
The program randomly selects text reviews from a dataset "which is provided bellow".
Both RoBERTa and VADER analyze the sentiment of the review.
The results from both models are compared to determine their effectiveness in different scenarios.
The project helps in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of deep learning vs. lexicon-based models in sentiment analysis.
Models Used:


RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach)
A transformer model known for its state-of-the-art NLP performance.
Context-aware and capable of understanding complex linguistic patterns.
Requires a pretrained model for inference and sentiment classification.


VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner):
A lexicon-based model that assigns polarity scores to words.
Optimized for short, informal text like social media comments.
Works well with rule-based sentiment calculations.
Key Features
✅ Dual Model Comparison – Enables analysis of when RoBERTa or VADER performs better.
✅ Random Review Selection – Ensures diverse and unbiased evaluation.
✅ Real-world Application – Useful for customer reviews, social media analysis, and business insights.
